# K2 Utilities

Added functionality---
1. Create template lightcurves of instrument systematics (similar to CBV vectors, but CCD, channel, module, magnitude specific) 
2. Metric to measure contamination in a real lightcurve using the CCD, magnitude specific template
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Forked Repo-

A small library of classes and functions for working with K2 data more efficiently.
A few ipython notebook tutorials have been included to get your started.

The repo will be renamed at some point, as the current name if left over from another project.

The following tutorial are available to help learn the library.  Follow them in the order given.

1. data\_download\_tutorial.ipynb

2. k2fov\_tutorial.ipynb

3. k2\_query\_tutorial.ipynb

4. container\_tutorial.ipynb (under construction)
